## Key Features
1. **Summary Statistics**
   - Total Earthquakes: **7,464**
   - Average Depth: **77.92 km**
   - Average NST (Number of Stations): **273.1**
   - Average Dimin: **4.264**
   - Average RMS: **1.008**
   - Max Gap: **230.4**
   - Average Gap: **30.42**

2. **Visualizations**
   - **Magnitude vs. Depth Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between earthquake magnitude and depth, highlighting trends and outliers.
   - **Total Earthquakes by Year**: A stacked area chart visualizing the yearly distribution of earthquakes by magnitude types (e.g., mb, ms, mw, etc.).
   - **Total Earthquakes by Area (Map)**: Geospatial distribution of earthquake occurrences.
   - **Total Earthquakes by Month**: A stacked bar chart representing earthquake counts by magnitude type across months.
   - **Magnitude Histogram**: Distribution of earthquakes by magnitude.
   - **Depth Histogram**: Distribution of earthquakes by depth (in kilometers).

3. **Table of Significant Earthquakes**
   - Displays detailed information about significant earthquakes, including:
     - **Date**
     - **Place**
     - **Magnitude**
     - **Depth**
     - **NST**

## Insights
- **Magnitude and Depth Relationship**: A majority of earthquakes with higher magnitudes tend to occur at shallower depths.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Earthquakes are concentrated along tectonic plate boundaries, particularly the Pacific Ring of Fire.
- **Seasonality**: Monthly distribution of earthquakes indicates consistent activity throughout the year.
- **Temporal Trends**: Significant increases in recorded earthquakes over time, likely due to improved detection technologies and reporting methods.

## Usage
This dashboard can be used by:
- **Seismologists**: To analyze patterns and characteristics of earthquake events.
- **Policy Makers**: To identify high-risk areas and prioritize disaster preparedness.
- **Researchers**: To explore relationships between magnitude, depth, and location.
