# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data, focusing on key metrics such as total vehicles, average electric range, and vehicle distribution by make, model, state, and year. It offers insights into EV trends, market share by manufacturer, and CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility status.

## Key Features

1. **Summary Metrics:**
   - Total Vehicles: 150,473
   - Average Electric Range: 67.88 miles
   - Total BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles): 116,802 (77.6% of total)
   - Total PBEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles): 33,671 (22.4% of total)

2. **Visualizations:**
   - **Line Chart:** Total vehicles by model year with historical trends.
   - **Map:** Geographic distribution of EVs by state.
   - **Bar Chart:** Top 10 total vehicles by make.
   - **Pie Chart:** Breakdown of CAFV eligibility.
   - **Table:** Total vehicles by models, including make, EV type, and percentage of total vehicles.

3. **Filters:**
   - CAFV Eligibility
   - EV Type
   - Model
   - State

## Insights

- **Market Leader:** Tesla dominates the market, contributing 52.71% of total vehicles (68,979 vehicles).
- **Model Insights:** Tesla Model Y and Model 3 are the top models, comprising 18.94% and 18.01% of total vehicles, respectively.
- **Yearly Trends:** A significant increase in EV adoption is observed from 2015 onwards, peaking in 2023.
